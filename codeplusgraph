Clustering before forecasting has became common trend now-a-days.

This small document tries to demonstrate quickly how, an kohenon clustering and som mapping, helps us in identifying different time series,
in the given bulk data which can of different Store Keeping Unit (SKU) sales or of different store sales itselfs.

Suppose, we have received >100 store sales data. Do you assume all store sales behave similarly, if it is not, then,
clustering sales at different stores gives us distinct stores they are not same.

Pragamatically, we if you Kohonen approach either in R or Python, we can get SOM graph attached separately, which tell my stores can are
grouped into four (4) which are distinct by their sales.

Further, if I look at the sales pattern of two different store (graph attached separately), you will observe no where both are similar.

Thus, clustering helps us in front, how to go about forecasting for such distinct stores.
